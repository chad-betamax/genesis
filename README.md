TL;DR: 

    $ cd ~/init
    $ ./configure
    $ invoke genesis
    $ ..; rm -r init


As far as possible have tried to install stuff with system package manager. 
Pip, npm etc only used if absolutely no other way.
Reason for this is intention is to do python development in containers (thereby avoiding
versioning problems etc  etc). So any piup[ installs are using *system* python.
